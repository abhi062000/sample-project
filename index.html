          <h3>Can We Guess Your Age?</h3>
          <p>
            It is getting increasingly challenging to distinguish people's age
            in today's times. Children are starting puberty earlier than in
            previous generations. People are also taking better care of
            themselves as they age. New trends in fashion can sometimes make
            someone look older or younger than they are. Can we guess your age?

          <h3>Find Your Lockdown Style</h3>
          <p>
            While many of us have (or have not! ) a personal style - that is, a
            fashion 'aesthetic' that describes how you dress - the coronavirus
            may have thrown it off. Usually, we are out and working, but during
            the lockdown, many of us are at home, with the motto 'Netflix and
            chill', or the rather more current one, 'quarantine and chill'. What
            we look like matters, especially in these special circumstances. We
            behave better and exhibit more manners when we are dressed properly,
            instead of when we look like a slob. Changing out of sleepwear does
            help work performance, and you'll get less energy slumps (pajamas
            send the subliminal message to the brain that it's nighttime). So,
            what's your lockdown style?.
